# ft_containers

Reimplementaion of C++98 STL containers. Subject can be found [here](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/47323/en.subject.pdf).

## Project goals

* Deeply understand containers structure, explore member types and functions
* Implement iterator system for each container type (where applicable)
* Produce tests, compare outputs and performance with original STL containers
* Use friend keyword for non-member overloads

### Container list

1. Vector
2. Map
3. Stack adaptor based on Vector (1) implementation
4. Set (based on Red-Black Tree)
